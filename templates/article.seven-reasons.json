Game pieces are typically\n                limited to just cards, so you can let the good times roll, even without dice. Plus, everyone knows at\n                least one game you can play with a generic deck of 52 playing cards. But sometimes the same old card\n                game can get a little boring. That’s where Doomlings comes in.<\/p>\n            <p>So wave bye-bye to Bridge, say “So long” to Spades , and let’s go over the top 7 reasons to play <a href=\"https:\/\/doomlings.com\/collections\/all\/products\/classic-doomlings-game\">Doomlings<\/a>!<\/p>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"seven-second-sec\">\n        <div>\n            <h2><span>1.<\/span> EXPERIENCE A FAMILY-FRIENDLY APOCALYPSE<\/h2>\n            <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0554\/6190\/4593\/files\/beaver-doom_480x480.png?v=1685729851\"\n                alt=\"Angry Beaver Doomling\">\n            <p>In science fiction stories, post-apocalyptic worlds are ones where the stakes are high, the danger is\n                imminent, and the tone is too dark for grandma.<\/p>\n            <p>Doomlings is a lighter take on the end of the world that has a little bit of something for everyone. It\n                trades carnage for cuteness, with adorable characters that kids obsess over. It trades gloom for\n                giggles, with jokes that appeal to children and chill adults. Set aside the morbid ideas you might have\n                about the world ending, because Doomlings is a chance to step outside your comfort zone and experience\n                something truly unique and exciting. It’s an apocalypse the whole family can enjoy!<\/p>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"seven-third-sec\">\n        <div>\n            <h2><span>2.<\/span> IT'S THE ULTIMATE GAME OF SURVIVAL<\/h2>\n            <div>\n                <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0554\/6190\/4593\/files\/prowler-doomling.png?v=1687280250\"\n                    alt=\"Prowler Doomling\">\n                <div>\n                    <p>Doomlings offers a dynamic and unpredictable gaming experience that you won’t find in your\n                        average card game.<\/p>\n                    <p>TRAITS - Every player starts out with 5 “Trait” cards in their hand. On your turn, you’ll play 1\n                        Trait from your hand into your “Trait Pile.” Many Traits have unique effects that will allow you\n                        to swap, steal, or draw cards, and all Traits give you points that contribute to your final\n                        score.<\/p>\n                    <p>GENE POOL - Each player will also have a “Gene Pool” card numbered 1 through 8, which keeps track\n                        of how many cards you should be holding in your hand when your turn ends. After you play a Trait\n                        into your Trait Pile, you’ll end your turn by drawing or discarding cards until the number of\n                        cards in your hand matches your Gene Pool. This process is called “stabilizing.”<\/p>\n                    <p>AGES - Rounds are called “Ages” in Doomlings. Each Age is guided by an Age card that is turned\n                        over at the start of each round. Each Age card will have a unique rule or effect that occurs\n                        during that round only.<\/p>\n                    <p>CATASTROPHES - Look out! Mixed in with the Ages are “Catastrophe” cards. Catastrophes have\n                        adverse effects on gameplay, like reducing Gene Pools or forcing players to discard. After three\n                        Catastrophes, the world ends, the game is over, and everyone counts up the points from the\n                        Traits in their Trait Pile to see who won!<\/p>\n                <\/div>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"seven-fourth-sec\">\n        <div>\n            <h2><span>3.<\/span> BUILD YOUR OWN UNIQUE IDENTITY<\/h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n                    <p>Your Trait Pile is more than just points. It’s a reflection of your play style! Did you play a\n                        lot of\n                        blue Traits? You might be a more defensive player, or someone who likes to cycle through cards.\n                        Purple Traits are a little more mischievous, with a lot of take-that mechanics like swaps and\n                        steals. If you have a lot of green Traits, chances are you like going for bonus points. Bold,\n                        aggressive Traits are usually found on red cards, while colorless Traits are more ethereal, with\n                        a\n                        grab bag of different types of effects.<\/p>\n                    <p>When the game is over, you can even imagine what your Doomling looks like with all of the Traits\n                        in\n                        your Trait Pile combined.
